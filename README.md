# 📘 Java Sprint Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Java Sprint Practice** repository! This collection includes my hands-on Java exercises completed during structured sprints as part of my full-stack development training. Each sprint focuses on core Java concepts, from basics to object-oriented programming, collections, file I/O, and more.

> ✅ **Built using IntelliJ IDEA and Git**  
> ✅ **Pushed to GitHub using Git CLI**  
> ✅ **Includes my Capstone CLI Project: DonateConnect**
