**Course Title: SE105 Managing and Querying Database**

# Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to provide you with a hands-on
opportunity to apply and consolidate the skills acquired throughout the
course. By working on a structured problem statement, you will
demonstrate your ability to design and develop a SQL-based application
that manages data, performs structured analysis, integrates Automation
insights, and ensures data integrity, security, and efficiency .

This project aims to develop and implement a robust database system that
efficiently defines, stores, manages, and retrieves data using SQL. It
encompasses the entire database management lifecycle, including
designing normalized schemas, enforcing constraints, optimizing queries,
and automating workflows for enhanced efficiency and reliability.

**Your task is to:**

1.  Choose a project scenario from the provided list.

2.  Design a well-structured database with normalized tables and
    relationships.

3.  Implement SQL constraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique, Not
    Null, Check) and create a script for Data Definition for data
    integrity.

4.  Optimize database performance using indexes and best practices.

5.  Solve the problem statements defined in choosen project.

6.  Present your findings and demonstrate the functionality of your
    solution.

# Project Objectives
